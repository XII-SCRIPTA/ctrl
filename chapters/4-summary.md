### Summary and Outlook

This technical compendium outlined the technical foundations for the `ctrl` framework. `ctrl` extends the baseline RSA model by providing a model of context for the built environment, and a model of discourse update to enable continuous interaction between buildings and occupants. 

To achieve this, we advanced three novel contributions to the RSA framework. Firstly, we outlined a simple **building ontology** which specifies the semantic meaning of utterances within the context of built environments. This provides the literal interpretation of utterances. Secondly, we extended the baseline RSA model in order to interpret the meaning of multiple referring expressions simulataniously. This allows enables multiword utterances like. This extends the one-shot interaction of baseline RSA to **multishot interaction**. Thirdly, we showed that Bayesian appraoches to linguistic pragmatics allow learned models to be audited through reverse Bayesian inference. This provides quantitative evidence for why the system produced a certain output, and furthermore, requires little to no additional code to implement.
